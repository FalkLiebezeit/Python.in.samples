# Introduction

This is an unofficial fork of the [sample code repo]((https://github.com/d3dcoder/d3d12book)) for [Frank D. Luna's](http://www.d3dcoder.net/default.htm) excellent book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm). No representation is made that the source code belongs to me, it's simply reproduced here for convenience and remains the copyright of Frank D. Luna.

A collection of *DirectX 12 C# samples*. All the samples have been ported to .NET using [SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org/).

# Building

The samples will compile with Visual Studio 2022+ and run on Windows 10+ with DirectX 12 capable graphics hardware.
Scenes can be rotated and zoomed using mouse buttons.
